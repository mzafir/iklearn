## **This is just a small thing for you to think about how to approach this** 

1. How can we just read the static properties in the txt file?
2. How can we stop the static properties and move on to the time series data
3. I didn't do this, can you write a function that will transform the strings of the static property values to proper floats in python?
4. Plot a simple line chart for visualize different volcanos and their respective eruptions
5. Can you write a script that can plot each volcano's by looping over all the text files in a directory?
